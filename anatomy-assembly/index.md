I am going to explain the anatomy of assembly code using RISC-V as an example since it's a clean, modern instruction set architecture (ISA) that's easy to understand. Assembly code is a low-level programming language that directly corresponds to machine instructions executed by a processor.

<!--more-->

Assembly is human-readable but closely tied to the hardware. Let us break it down step-by-step and then dive into RISC-V examples.

## Instructions

1. These are the basic operations the CPU executes (e.g., `add`, `load`, `jump`).
1. In assembly, each line typically represents one instruction.
1. Instructions consist of an **opcode** (operation code) and **operands** (data or registers to operate on).

## Registers

1. Small, fast storage locations inside the CPU.
1. RISC-V has `32` general-purpose registers, labeled `x0` to `x31`. Some have special purposes (e.g., `x0` is always `zero`).
1. Assembly code often manipulates data in registers rather than memory for speed.

## Operands

1. Can be **registers**, **immediate values** (constants), or **memory addresses**.
1. Example:
    1. `add x1, x2, x3` uses registers as operands;
    1. `addi x1, x2, 5` uses an immediate value (5).

## Syntax

1. Typically: `[opcode] [destination], [source1], [source2]`.
1. RISC-V uses a consistent format, often with commas separating operands.

## Labels

1. Symbolic names for memory addresses, used for jumps or branches (e.g., loops or function calls).
1. Example: loop: marks a spot in the code.

## Comments

1. Ignored by the assembler, used for human readability.
1. In RISC-V, comments start with `#`.

## Directives

Commands to the assembler (not CPU instructions), like `.data` to define data or `.text` for code sections.

## RISC-V Instruction Types

RISC-V has a reduced instruction set, meaning it keeps things simple with a few key instruction formats:
1. **R-type**: Register-to-register operations (e.g., arithmetic).
1. **I-type**: Immediate operations (e.g., add a constant).
1. **S-type**: Store instructions (save to memory).
1. **B-type**: Branch instructions (conditional jumps).
1. **U-type**: Upper immediate (large constants).
1. **J-type**: Jump instructions (unconditional jumps).

# Code Examples

Now, let us see this in action with examples. Examples of RISC-V Assembly Code

### Basic Arithmetic (R-type and I-type)

Let's add two numbers stored in registers and then add a constant.

```asm
# Add two registers: x1 = x2 + x3
# R-type: x1 gets the sum of x2 and x3
add x1, x2, x3

# Add an immediate value: x4 = x1 + 10
# I-type: x4 gets x1 plus 10
addi x4, x1, 10
```

1. `add` is an R-type instruction: it operates on three registers.
1. `addi` is an I-type instruction: it uses two registers and an immediate value.
1. Anatomy: `[opcode] [destination], [source1], [source2 or immediate]`.

### Loading and Storing Data (I-type and S-type)

Let's load a value from memory into a register and store it back elsewhere.
```asm
# Load word from memory address in x5 into x6
 # I-type: Load word from address (x5 + 0) into x6
lw x6, 0(x5)

# Store x6 into memory at address in x7
# S-type: Store word from x6 into address (x7 + 4)
sw x6, 4(x7)
```

1. `lw` (load word) fetches 32 bits from memory into a register.
1. `sw` (store word) writes a register's value to memory.

The number (e.g., 0 or 4) is an offset added to the base address in the register.

### Branching (B-type)

Let's write a simple loop that increments a counter until it hits 5.

```asm
# Initialize x1 to 0
# x0 is always 0, so x1 = 0
addi x1, x0, 0

loop:
  # Increment x1 by 1
  addi x1, x1, 1

  # If x1 == x5, jump to 'exit' (assume x5 holds 5)
  beq x1, x5, exit

  # Jump back to 'loop'
  j loop

exit:
  # Program ends
```

1. `beq` (branch if equal) compares two registers and jumps if they're equal.
1. `j` (jump) is a J-type instruction for unconditional jumps.
1. `loop:` and `exit:` are labels marking addresses.

### Function Call (J-type and I-type)

Let's call a subroutine to double a number.

```asm
# Main program

# x1 = 3
addi x1, x0, 3

# Jump to 'double', store return address in x10
jal x10, double

# Subroutine to double x1
double:
  # x2 = x1 + x1 (double it)
  add x2, x1, x1

  # Return to address in x10 (x0 discards link)
  jalr x0, x10, 0

# Back in main, x2 now holds 6
```

1. `jal` (jump and link) jumps to a label and saves the return address.
1. `jalr` (jump and link register) returns using the address in `x10`.
1. Registers like `x10` are conventionally used for return addresses.

### Data Section (Directives)

Let's define some data and use it.

```asm
# Data section
.data
  # Define a 32-bit word with value 42
  my_num: .word 42

# Code section
.text
  # Load address of 'my_num' into x1
  la x1, my_num

  # Load the value (42) into x2
  lw x2, 0(x1)
```

1. `.data` and `.text` are directives telling the assembler where data and code go.
1. `la` (load address) is a pseudo-instruction that simplifies getting a label's address.

## Putting It All Together

Here's a small program to sum numbers 1 to 5:

```asm
# Sum numbers from 1 to 5

# Counter (i)
addi x1, x0, 0

# Sum
addi x2, x0, 0

# Limit
addi x3, x0, 5

loop:
  # i++
  addi x1, x1, 1

  # sum += i
  add x2, x2, x1

  # If i != 5, repeat
  bne x1, x3, loop

# x2 now holds 15 (1+2+3+4+5)
```

1. Uses registers `x1`, `x2`, `x3`.
1. Combines I-type (`addi`), R-type (`add`), and B-type (`bne`).

# Things to remember about RISC-V Assembly

1. **Fixed-length instructions**: All are 32 bits, making decoding simple.
1. **Load/store architecture**: Only lw and sw access memory; arithmetic uses registers.
1. **Minimalist design**: Fewer instructions than complex ISAs like x86, but still powerful.

Hopefully, this breakdown gave you a solid grasp of assembly code anatomy through RISC-V.
