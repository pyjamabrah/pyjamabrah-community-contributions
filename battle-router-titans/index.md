What does a humble device like a router do? To most, a router is used till it breaks like many other devices in the house. The router plays such an important role by making sure your netflix works smoothly. However, a solo glance at its shell will reveal a battle raged for OpenWRT, RDK, and prplOS.

<!--more-->

Considering wifi router firmware is a superhuman, open wrt would be a batman. Super flexible and requires skill. Manages corporation while getting resources: this would be RDK, while ant man, slim and astute represents prplOS. Each one has its constituents but which one should you depend on the most?

# Origins and Purpose

## OpenWRT: The Rebel Hacker’s Dream
An anti-establishment firmware for anti establishment users, openWRT likens itself to punk rock. One of the most famous options among twitch bois ever since it first shown in 04, skilled users of linking their mic to their private channel.
